# PROGRESS

Append one entry per session. Newest at the bottom. Keep entries under 10 lines.
This file is how the next session learns where the last one stopped — it is read
every time, so do not let it grow into an essay.

**Format**

```
## S<n> — <layer / what was built>            <date>
Built:    <files created or changed>
Proves:   <what the tests assert and that they pass>
Decided:  <any judgement call the next session must respect>
Next:     <the step number that should follow>

## S0 — scaffold                                     2026-08-24
Built:    repo restored from Plan-Gen-backup.zip (4 commits of v1 history intact);
          v1 `planfgen/` git-mv'd to `legacy/planfgen/` + `legacy/README.md`;
          v2 skeleton `planfgen/{brief,topology,partition,fabric,services,circulation,
          openings,habitability,evaluate,search,document,tests}/` (__init__.py only);
          fixtures git-mv'd to `planfgen/tests/fixtures/`; `pyproject.toml`.
Proves:   nothing functional — `import planfgen` succeeds, `pytest` collects 0 tests
          with no collection error (exit 5).
Decided:  repo root is the working dir; v1 preserved under `legacy/` for A/B only,
          never imported. `planfgen-v2-kit/` (holds PROMPTS.md) is gitignored.
Next:     S1 — L0 brief/ and the feasibility gate

## S1 — L0 brief/ and the feasibility gate            2026-08-24
Built:    `planfgen/brief/{programme,parcel,regulation,feasibility,plan}.py` and
          `planfgen/tests/test_brief.py`. `Brief.load()` gates on `AreaBudget`
          and raises `InfeasibleBrief` carrying it.
Proves:   13 tests pass. Edge orientations for north=0 and north=pi/2 (and a CW
          ring); MITOYEN/RETRAIT not openable; MITOYEN entry rejected;
          `estimate_partition_length(7, 95.76)` = 33.66 m; the v1 7-room fixture
          reproduces ARCHITECTURE section 3 exactly — interior 95.76, habitable
          92.39, deficit 10.61 m2.
Decided:  Bearings run clockwise from +Y as `atan2(x, y)`, minus `north`; the
          outward normal flips with ring winding rather than reordering edges.
          `from_json` is strict on v2 field names — the v1 nom->RoomType map
          lives in the test adapter, not in the library. `min_area`/`min_width`
          hold only the room types v1 stated; the rest carry no minimum.
          `AreaBudget.partition_estimate` is a length in m, not an area.
Next:     S2 — L1 topology/
