# PROGRESS

Append one entry per session. Newest at the bottom. Keep entries under 10 lines.
This file is how the next session learns where the last one stopped — it is read
every time, so do not let it grow into an essay.

**Format**

```
## S<n> — <layer / what was built>            <date>
Built:    <files created or changed>
Proves:   <what the tests assert and that they pass>
Decided:  <any judgement call the next session must respect>
Next:     <the step number that should follow>

## S0 — scaffold                                     2026-08-24
Built:    repo restored from Plan-Gen-backup.zip (4 commits of v1 history intact);
          v1 `planfgen/` git-mv'd to `legacy/planfgen/` + `legacy/README.md`;
          v2 skeleton `planfgen/{brief,topology,partition,fabric,services,circulation,
          openings,habitability,evaluate,search,document,tests}/` (__init__.py only);
          fixtures git-mv'd to `planfgen/tests/fixtures/`; `pyproject.toml`.
Proves:   nothing functional — `import planfgen` succeeds, `pytest` collects 0 tests
          with no collection error (exit 5).
Decided:  repo root is the working dir; v1 preserved under `legacy/` for A/B only,
          never imported. `planfgen-v2-kit/` (holds PROMPTS.md) is gitignored.
Next:     S1 — L0 brief/ and the feasibility gate
